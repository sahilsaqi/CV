As a passionate researcher with a strong academic background in Artificial Intelligence, I specialize in indoor localization, LiDAR-SLAM, and multi-modal data fusion techniques. Currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence Convergence at Pukyong National University, South Korea, I’m deeply involved in research projects that combine Machine Learning, computer vision, and SLAM for enhanced localization systems. My work has been presented at conferences like KICSP and is under review in top-tier journals.

In addition to my research, I have industry experience as a Software Developer, where I developed and optimized web applications, significantly improving performance and user experience. I have also undertaken diverse projects, including a content-based movie recommender system and a real-time posture detection system using machine learning libraries such as p5.js and ml5.js.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2025 to further my research in Machine Learning, computer vision, robotics, and LiDAR. Let’s connect if you’re interested in collaboration or research discussions!
